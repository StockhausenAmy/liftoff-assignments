### What I'll Have to Learn
-- I'm most interested in middle- and back-end development, so I'm up for learning any technologies to make our logic and storage functions more useful.
1. Public API - recipe services, nutrition information services, Weight Watchers point system
2. Connecting front end tech to back end tech - familiarization with MVC architecture
3. Database storage of various items: formatted text (specifically, the list of steps, which may have rich formatting), images
4. React - instead of using Thymeleaf for frontend
5. Flexbox - page layouts
